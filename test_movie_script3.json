ENDING POSITION - The shot concludes as the same wide, static view, with the character of Nova visible as a small, focused figure at her workstation in the center background.\nCHARACTER: Nova, a 25-year-old Japanese-American woman with a sharp, athletic build, sits hunched over her workstation. Her jet-black hair is styled in a precise undercut. Two glowing cyan circular neural implants are embedded at her temples, pulsing with a slow, soft light that illuminates the sides of her face.\nACTION: Nova's face is bathed in the shifting light of the holographic interfaces. Cascading lines of green and blue code scroll across her dark, focused eyes. Her fingers move with silent precision across a holographic keyboard, manipulating the data streams.",
